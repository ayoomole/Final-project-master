              <h2 class="about">1. Project Overview</h2>
              <p class="doc-text">
                Focus Timer is a web-based application aimed at helping young
                individuals increase their productivity and manage their time
                effectively with the Pomodoro technique. This solution includes
                two main feature sets which are the Pomodoro Timer and
                Stopwatch, both designed to be a lightweight alternative to
                downloaded applications that can take up useful space on the
                user’s digital device. The target audience for this project
                includes students, professionals, and anyone seeking to improve
                their focus and productivity. <br> The key features of the Pomodoro
                Timer with Stopwatch include: <br>Pomodoro Timer: Allows users to
                set a focused work session for 25 minutes, followed by a
                5-minute break. The cycle is repeated as many times as the user
                wants. <br>Stopwatch: Provides a flexible timer that can be manually
                adjusted for any custom time duration. This is more useful for
                other tasks that require a specific time. <br>Audio Alert: Notifies
                users with a sound alert when the timer or stopwatch session is
                complete. A quick alarm sound that lets the user know when it’s
                time to pause and relax, or get back to work. <br>Background Image:
                Displays a random background image from the Unsplash API to feed
                visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing images that
                intrigue the user. <br>Random Motivational Quote: Fetches a random quote from an
                external API to provide users with inspiration and motivation
                during their work sessions.
              </p>
              <h2 class="about">2. Website Navigation:</h2>
              <p class="doc-text">
                One of the selling points of Focus Timer is the ease of
                Navigation. We aim to get the users timer’s set up in under 5
                seconds. Therefore, Navigation is simple and straightforward
                with no unnecessary pages. We have two main pages on the
                website, which are the Pomorodoro Timer and Stopwatch.
              </p>

              <h2 class="about">3. External Libraries Used</h2>
              <p class="doc-text">
                Google Fonts: Google Fonts library was used to integrate custom
                fonts into the project's text elements, improving the typography
                and overall design. <br>Font Awesome Icons: Font Awesome library
                provides a wide range of icons that can be easily incorporated
                into the project's user interface. We used icons such as play,
                pause, reset buttons, and more.
              </p>
              <h2 class="about">4. APIs Used</h2>
              <p class="doc-text">
                Unsplash API: Utilized to fetch random background images for the
                application. It provides a vast collection of high-quality
                photos that enhance the user experience. The API endpoint used
                is https://api.unsplash.com/photos/random. Random Quote API:
                Used to retrieve random quotes for display within the
                application. The specific API endpoint and details depend on the
                chosen random quote API service.
              </p>
              <h2 class="about">5. Data Collected from APIs</h2>
              <p class="doc-text">
                Image: Retrieved from the Unsplash API to dynamically set the
                background image of the application, creating an engaging visual
                ambience. <br>Random Quote: Fetched from the Random Quote API to
                display a random quote within the application, offering users
                inspiration and motivation during their work sessions. The
                Pomodoro Timer with Stopwatch uses both local functionality and
                external API integrations to enhance the user experience and
                provide valuable features. The Unsplash API provides visually
                appealing background images, while the Random Quote API adds an
                element of inspiration to boost productivity.
